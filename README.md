==========

BSharpTree is a .NET B+Tree implementation.  This project is a fork of the BPlusDotNet project by Aaron Waters. The main difference is that:   a) Generics allow storage and retrieval of any data type for keys and values b) Operates against a stream, so can flexibly be on disk or in memory c) Maintained (BPlusDotNet hasn't had a commit since 2005)  The name is just a play on words.. Like C->C++->C#, this is B-Tree->B-PlusTree->BSharpTree.. Hahaha.
